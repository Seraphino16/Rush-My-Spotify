# Rush Spotify

This is a school project made in three days in a group of three persons.

## Technologies

With this project we have discovered `React JS` and how to use `API` with `Docker`.

## Goal

We need to create a few pages including :
  - `home page` with random album recommanations
  - `artists`, `genres` and `albums` lists
  - `artist` detail
  - `album detail` where we can play the music


## How to run it

Inside the my_app repository, run :
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Now you should see 'Hello world' when browsing http://localhost:8000/ .

You can see how the API works with the url : http://localhost:8000/api .

Then to start the app server run :
```bash
npm start
```
